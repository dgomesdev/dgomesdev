<h1 align = "justify"> Nice to meet you! I'm Danilo, Mobile Developer <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"></h1>

After a career change, I became an app development professional. I have 4 years' experience in international trade working in various corporate environments, including an agency of the French Embassy in Brazil, contributing to the commercial development of French companies in various technology verticals, where it was possible to observe the different challenges faced when it comes to understanding customer demands.

During my career, I have identified that many companies need to continuously improve their products and services in order to better serve their customers, seeking to understand their needs and proposing assertive solutions to respond to these problems. My aim is to help companies overcome these challenges by combining my technical knowledge of programming and business knowledge.

I understand that the absence of a team committed to understanding the customer's business can lead to incorrect technical decisions and a loss of alignment between the expectations of the developers, the customer and the users. When developing applications, I ensure that I meet not only the technical requirements, but also those of the company's business, thereby minimising these problems and maximising the synergy between the various stakeholders.

I am committed to collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to develop and implement solutions tailored to the specific needs of each client. My focus is not only to develop applications, but also to contribute to requirements analysis, communication between different teams and customer service, transforming the development of an application into a satisfactory experience for everyone.
